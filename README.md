This study using rhythmic transcranial magentic stimulation (rTMS) was designed to gain further understanding of how the working memory retains information.
Theory, design and statistical analysis were performed during a course ("Empirisches Praktikum") in the second semester of the BSc Psychology at LMU.
Due to the corona crisis it was not possible to do the testing in the laboratory on rel people. All data used in the statistical analysis is thus simulated.
